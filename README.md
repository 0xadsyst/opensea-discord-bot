# Python Discord Bot
NOTE: This project is not actively maintained, OpenSea regularly makes changes to their API and may break the bot functionality.

This is a minimal Discord bot for NFT communities written in Python. It can pull the floor price and other statistics from OpenSea and report on sales and listings.

To setup:
1. Follow [this guide](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html) to setup your Discord bot. 
2. Enter the Discord bot and server details, and your OpenSea API key.
3. Deploy locally or on a hosted platform such as [Heroku](https://discord.com/developers/docs/tutorials/hosting-on-heroku).
